SassCalc is a web-based calculator that hates math as much as you do. It gives correct answers only half the time and the rest of the time, it mocks you for even asking. With an AI character that reacts with sarcasm and sass, this calculator makes simple arithmetic unnecessarily dramatic.

### Project Description
SassCalc is a web-based calculator that hates math as much as you do. It gives correct answers only half the time and the rest of the time, it mocks you for even asking. With an AI character that reacts with sarcasm and sass, this calculator makes simple arithmetic unnecessarily dramatic.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Calculators are too boring. They just... calculate. Where‚Äôs the emotional trauma? The judgment? The existential dread after doing 2 + 2?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a calculator with built-in sarcasm. Ask it a simple question? Prepare for an eye roll. Ask it something complex? It pretends to sweat. Sometimes it gives the right answer, sometimes it just gives up. Either way, it talks back. And yes, it‚Äôs pastel-themed ‚Äì because aesthetic bullying matters.
